# NAND2Tetris

This is a repo to follow along and build the projects from the book "The Elements of Computing Systems", aka [NAND2Tetris][1]. The software provided with the book is under the [GNU GPL][2] license, so my code will be made available under this license too.

No idea how long it will take to complete, or *if* I will ever complete this, but the goal is to build it in the Go programming language (the book uses Java).
